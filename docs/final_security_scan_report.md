# Final Security Scan Report

## Introduction
This document presents the results of the final security scan performed on the Terraform codebase. The purpose of this scan was to verify the resolution of the top 5 security issues previously identified and to ensure the overall security posture of the infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Methodology
The security scan was conducted using the Checkov static code analysis tool. Checkov is an open-source tool used for detecting misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and other IaC frameworks.

The following command was executed to perform the scan:

```bash
checkov -d terraform/
```

## Scan Results
The scan focused on verifying the fixes applied to the top 5 security issues, which included:

1. Insecure S3 bucket configurations
2. Lack of data encryption
3. Use of default network settings
4. Missing logging/monitoring
5. Hardcoded secrets

### Summary of Findings
- **Insecure S3 Bucket Configurations**: All S3 buckets have been configured with proper access controls and policies to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Lack of Data Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit has been enabled for all applicable resources, ensuring data confidentiality.
- **Use of Default Network Settings**: Custom network configurations have been applied, replacing default settings to enhance network security.
- **Missing Logging/Monitoring**: Logging and monitoring have been enabled for all critical components, allowing for real-time security and performance insights.
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Secrets management has been implemented using AWS Secrets Manager, eliminating hardcoded secrets in the codebase.

No new issues were introduced, and all previously identified security concerns have been successfully addressed.

## Conclusion
The final security scan confirms that the Terraform codebase is now configured with a strong security posture. The resolution of the top 5 security issues significantly reduces the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security threats. For continuous improvement, integrate regular security scans into the CI/CD pipeline to detect and mitigate issues early. It is recommended to continue regular security scans as part of the development lifecycle to maintain and improve the security posture over time.
